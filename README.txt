Memo-Mail is a very simple smtp-client that allows you to quickly send mails to a specific e-mail address so that you can send links or notes from work to home for example. Once configured this program only shows a send form you can fill with text. With double enter the mail will be sent in background. 

Important notice
----------------
You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with .Net-Framework 2.0 or higher for compiling the source code.
The current version is alpha and not suitable for productive use.
